## How it works
1. The app makes temporary chatrooms based on **The friends of your friends**. In Circle your friends are called actually called **Permis**. And the friends of your friends are called **Temps**. The registration works through OTP verification of phone number and a password.

2. Once inside a chatroom both the people can talk anonymously and then decide whether they want to -
    1. Skip to the next temp.
    2. Like the current temp.
    3. Skip the current temp and turn matching off.
    
3. If both the temps in a chatroom like each other at the same time, they are shifted to each other matches, where their identity is revealed. Their previous chat persists

4. Users can turn their matching on or off at any time, making them available, or unavailable for chatrooms. As the app can match you with a person even when you're offline!

One of the most popular ways to date, Circle brings the concept online in a safe and easy manner.
Add your friends, talk to their friends, match with them, and date them.
Scared that it might be embarrassing to talk to or match with someone who you have a mutual friend with?
Don’t worry about it! Once you tap the ‘start matching’ button you connect with people who match your gender preferences. But your identity is not revealed. The only thing you know about the person you’re talking to is that they have mutual friends with you. Oh! And specially curated cue cards that act as great conversation starters and help you get to know the other person better. 

Once you’ve talked to the other person and feel like you want to know their identity, tap the like icon. If they’ve done the same your identities will be revealed and you can know them further in the matches section and possibly date them. You can use it to increase your social network as well. This functionality provides the users with certain benefits such as:
1) Getting better quality matches as you get to talk to the other person 
 before knowing their identity
2) It is one of the safest ways to meet people online. You only connect with people your friends know and your identity is not revealed till the time you want it to be revealed
3) Since you don’t get to know the other person’s identity till you both like each other you can talk without feeling hesitant
4) The matches are more personality based than appearance based
5) You get to create your own dating pool

## Streams
Streams are groups that help you match with anyone who has joined them. They are based on common hobbies, passions, professions, universities, cities etc. All you have to do is go on the multiple users icon, click on the streams option and join the streams which suit you. You will connect with other members who have joined that stream.

## Global Stream
Everyone can join the global stream. It is not based on any common factor and is a default stream. It is there to help you connect with new people. You can see the other person’s profile before liking them.
