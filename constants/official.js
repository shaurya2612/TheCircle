      'I clicked on the start matching button but didn’t match with anyone. Why is that?',
    answer:
      'Circle works in the way that it connects you with your friends friends. So check if you’ve added your friends. Sometimes the case maybe if you have a small pool that your potential matches are talking to someone and aren’t available. In that case you might be in the waiting list till someone is free. You can increase your circle in that case. Add more friends. This is a rare case though.',

    question:
      'I liked the person I am talking to. How should I get to know   their identity?',
    answer:
      'If you like the person you are talking to and want to know them further press the 3 dots on the top and click on the like button. If both of you have liked each other your identities will be revealed. Your chat will be moved to the matches section (heart button).',

  {
    question:
      'What happens if one person presses the like button and the other doesn’t?',
    answer:
      'People move at different paces and may take time to decide whether they like someone. If one of you presses the like button your chat will continue in the same manner as before till the time the other person presses the like button as well. In case one person doesn’t press the like button and presses the skip button you both will connect with new people without your identities being revealed.',

    question: 'Can I talk to my friends on the app?',
    answer:
      'No, you won’t be able to talk to your friends on the app as they will strictly act as matchmakers',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I match with my friends on the app?',
    answer:
      'No, you won’t match with your friends on the app as they act as your matchmakers. So our advice, if you like someone, don’t add them as your friend! You will just end up friend zoning yourself',
